<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Assignment 8 Solution">Unzip and open the Retail SolutionRetail Solution.sln file. Open the Code Editor window. The code declares and initializes a class-level array named wholesale. The retailButton_Click procedure should ask the user for a percentage amount and then use that amount to increase each price stored in the array. The increased prices should be displayed in the retailListBox. Save the solution and then start the application. Click the Exit button and then close the solution. Zip the project folder into a single zip file and submit it to the form inside this folder.
